Please create a screen recording where you explain TypeScript decorators. In your explanation, make sure to cover what decorators are, the types of decorators (like class, method, and property decorators), and how they are used in TypeScript with examples. Show practical use cases, such as how decorators are applied in Angular for dependency injection or metadata annotations. Also, explain how decorators enhance or modify the behavior of classes and methods.
